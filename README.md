# ENTR-451 Homework Assignment #1

In this assignment, you'll be building the domain model, database structure, and data for "KMDB" (the Kellogg Movie Database). The end product will be a report that prints the movies and the top-billed cast for each movie in the database.

### Getting Started

- Use this template to create a new GitHub repository (click *Use this template* at the top of this page); be sure that the new repository in your account is named `hw1`
- Open the new repository (the one in your GitHub account – it should be called `_Your GitHub Username_/hw1`) in Gitpod. 
- Create a new SQLite database by typing `sqlite3 kmdb.sqlite3`
- Complete the assignment per the detailed instructions found in the comments of `kmdb.sql`, executing the script by using the `.read kmdb.sql` command.
- Commit and sync often! When complete, ensure that your most up-to-date, finished work lives in your GitHub repository, then, submit the URL to your GitHub repository page – i.e. `https://github.com/_Your GitHub Username_/hw1`
